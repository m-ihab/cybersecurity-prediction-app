 Cybersecurity Attack Prediction Web App
This project is a web application designed to predict the type of cybersecurity attack based on input data using a machine learning model. Built with Flask, it integrates predictive analytics with an intuitive interface for ease of use.

Features:
Predicts cybersecurity attack types (e.g., DDoS, Intrusion, Malware).
Simple and user-friendly web interface.
Machine learning model trained on real-world cybersecurity datasets.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Data: Dataset for training attack predictions



Completed:
 -Data Engineering: Feature extraction with scaling, principal component analysis
 -Modelling: Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest, XGBoost and Neural Network
 -Flask Webapp

Issues:
 -Preprocessing data samples on the web app for the model to predict (issues with structure keys and propably dataframe headers, look into preprocessing.py)
 	Startup: run app.py from the webapp directory and read terminal :)
